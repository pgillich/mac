## Hungarian keyboard layout extension

1. In Simple modifications, define **left_command** -> **left_control** and **left_control** -> **left_command** replacements
1. In Complex modifications, click on *Add rule*, click on *Enable All* of line **AltGr for Hungarian**.
1. Review Devices (Apple Internal Keyboard may not needed to be activated)
1. Close Karabiner-Elements

Features:

* Most important `AltGr` keys work
